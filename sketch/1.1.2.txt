1. Maximum number of edges given constraints (no loops, no parallel edges) is a complete graph K_n, so nC2 = n(n-1)/2

2. Suppose otherwise. We know there are even number of odd degrees, since SUM deg = 2 |E|. So there can be no odd degree vertices, since otherwise we would have duplicates. But the max degree of a graph is n-1 (connected to every other vertex), so degree is between 0 and n-1, not enough numbers to cover n things without odd numbers, contradiction. 

3. 

4. If no such path exists, the two odd vertices are on separate connected components A and B. Consider A by itself, it is a connected graph, but it has an odd number of vertice with odd degree, contradiction.

5. a) Consider the following algorithm 
Pick random v \in G
i = 0
Mark v as i, 
randomly pick a vertex adjacent to v that isn't marked by a number yet, and go there (v = adj v)
i += 1
Stop if every adjacent vertex to v has been marked 

Once this algorithm ends, we have a path marked 0, 1, ..., i, but since minimum degree is k, and all adj vertices of v have been marked, there are at least k + 1 vertices in the path, which is a path of length k

b) Do the same as above, but connect the last vertex to an adj vertex with minimum marking. since the path from lowest i to end vertex is k long, the cycle created is at least k+1

6. Induct on the length of the walk 

7. Drawn 

8. Suppose they didn't share a vertex. Since G is conneced, exists a path from v1 to uv. Let vi be the last vetex in P3 also in P1 and uj last vetex in P3 also in P2. 
This path is longer than P1 and P2, a contradiction

9. (n-1)C2 ?

10. Inductio on n, prove that minimum edges needed to have a connected graph is n - 1 (tree). 

11. => Suppose e is a birdgeo f G. (consider G-e we show no path exists from u to v, not connected so no cycle)
<= Suppose e is not a bridge. the G - e is still connected, i.e. thereexists path from uv = e u to v, this path + e s a cycle 

12. a) Can have no bridges and more than one cycle (consider calculator 8)
b) Same as if G has a bridge ethen G has a cut vertex. Suppose G has bridge av. A is a cut vertex since deleting u deletes bridge av, thus must result in more connected components
c) False, consider hourglass looking graph n = 5

Lemma: Let G be connected. e = uv \in G is an edge <=> no  u-v path exists in G-e 
13. redirection. Supose every v in G in cycle, delete v, any path using v can be rerouted.   

14. Suppose G has no cycle and is connected. Consider v \in V s.t. deg(v) > 1, and x, y s.t. vx, yv \in E. Graph G - v is disconnected since no path exists from x to y. if there was, would be a cycle in G. if order = 2, couldnt' have cycle 

15. a) done
b) #written down

16. b)
*-* *-*
a) Suppose G wasn't connected, must have more than 1 connected component, and one of them has <= vertices, which implies minimum degree is less than n-1/2
