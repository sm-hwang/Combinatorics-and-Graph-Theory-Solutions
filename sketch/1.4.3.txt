6. Is in fact false, since a graph of order n with no edges has \alpha(G) = n > n / 2 
So G was connected
consider I = max independent set, and G - I, |I| = \alpha. if deg of one vertex is k, we have k * \alpha edges from I to G - I, but istributing but 
k * alpha / |G - I| < k since |G - I| < alpha

10. a) G - S, consider hamiltonian cycle, a_1, ..., a_n. this cycle - S has at most S gaps, so at most |S| connected components. 
b) has at most |S|+1 gaps, so |S|+1 connected components. 

12.
a) abs(n_1 - n_2) <= 1
b) same as above and min(n_1, n_2) >= 2

13.
a) 
b)
