1. G is connected, label all graphs with weight 1 and run Kruskals. Since Kruskals guarantees a minimum spanning tree, this is a spanning tree. 

2. => Supp G is tree. connected by definition, and G contains all its vertices (connected) so is spanning tree.
<= We show the Graph is the spanning tree (so unique). if not, then can't be becauseo f extra vertex (connected),
so must be extra edge so must have extra edges (cycle). delete edge in edge in such a C not in T, show this is a different spanning tree.

3. [Contradiction] Let T span G. Suppose |T doesn't contain any edges in C, then T contains C, so T has cycle, contradiction. 

4. 
=> [Contra] Supp thereexists spanning T s.t. e \notin T. T spans subgraph G - e, there exists a path from u to v (e = uv) in T, so G not disconnected, e is not bridge.
<= Supp e not bridge. Then G - e is connected, G - e has spanning tree T, this is a spanning tree of G that doesn't contain e. 

5. a) give two examples 
b) has unique edge weights
