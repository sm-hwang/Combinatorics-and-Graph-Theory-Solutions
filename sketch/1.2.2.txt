5. 0, walk of odd length, but the direct length between (1,5) is even

6. a) Suppose ksi the smallest pos integer s.t. all entries of at least one row of S_r are postiive
From 1), we know that for the row with all pos entries, (say j), r = ec(v_j) Since itwa s the smallest pos int s.t. we have ecc(v_j) = r <= ecc(v_i) \forall i, thus is a min, aka rad(G)
b) Let m smallest pos int s.t. _____________
considering s_{m-1}, not all rows have all pos, i s.t. {i | row i has no 0 in s_{m-1}. max{ecc(v_i) | row i has no 0 in s_{m-1}} < ecc(v_j)

7.
S = [0] # zero matrix (n by n)
k = 0
while everyrow has a 0:
    s += A^k
    k += 1
return r where [A]_r has no zeros
