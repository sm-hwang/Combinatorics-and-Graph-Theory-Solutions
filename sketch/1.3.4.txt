1. sequence records neighbor of smallest leaf and deletes, only way for leaf to be recorded if its neighbour of smallest leaf left, but then its K2 and algo stops

ALl but two vertices disappear, for v to disappers it needs to become leaf, all but one adj must get removed, when they do recorded each time. 
If v doesn't disappear, vertex of k2 at the end of algo. 

4. Stars 

5. Paths 

6. K_n contains nC2 edges, each tree contains n -1 edges, so each edge belongs to (n-1)/nC2 = 2/n trees, so 1 - 2/n trees don't contain the edge, (n - 2)/n n^(n - 2) don't contain e.

7. Use Matrix Tree Theorem to prove Cayley's THeorem.
