        If $T$ has order $n$, it has $n - 1$ edges. Having an even number of edges 
        then implies that there are an odd number of vertices. If all the degrees 
        of the vertices were odd, then the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is
        odd, which contradicts that $\sum_{v \in V(T)} deg(v) = 2|E(T)|$.
    \item
        Let $v \in V(T)$ be the vertex with the maximum degree. Consider 
        $T - \{v\}$, which is a forest of $\delta$ trees. The resulting 
        trees are either $K_1$, which means that it was a leaf in $T$, or has 
        order greater than $1$. These trees have at least $2$ leaves, with at most 
        one created from the deletion of $v$. Thus $T$ has at least $\delta$ leaves.
